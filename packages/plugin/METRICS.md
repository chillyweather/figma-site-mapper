```

**After:** Full testability

```typescript
// Test hooks
describe("useSettings", () => {
  it("loads settings from storage");
  it("saves settings with debounce");
});

// Test components
describe("CrawlingTab", () => {
  it("renders correctly");
  it("handles user input");
});

// Test utilities
describe("validation", () => {
  it("parses input correctly");
});
```
